            <p>This is an analysis of teachers' attitudes concerning their use of First Language <code>(L1)</code> <code>(Spanish)</code> when teaching a Second Language <code>(L2)</code> <code>(English)</code>. The study is conducted in the Western area of the Central Valley in Costa Rica in which English is taught as a Foreign Language <code>(FL)</code>. The main topic is brought to light by noticing the norms English teachers have in their work environments. In most public education institutions, English educators and students are not openly allowed to include L1 in their tasks as the Ministry of Public Education of Costa Rica has suggested it in the general curricular program. (MEP, 2017). Also, the researchers themselves have experienced the effects of using L1 in their English classes in the University of Costa Rica.
            </p>
            <p>Regarding previous studies, some authors argue that using L1 in an L2 lesson is not entirely wrong. Many researchers began to study the students&#39 reactions concerning the teacher's use of L1 in classes through the years. For example, Fallas (2019) analyzed students of the EFL program at a Costa Rican university about their spontaneous and intuitive translanguaging. He found out that senior students use translanguaging for different purposes, such as giving their opinions, offering critiques, asking questions, expressing emotions, narrating something, and others. Moreover, empirical literature has also reported on instructors&#39 attitudes about the use of L1 in their classrooms. For instance, Akulova (2019) focused on teachers&#39 attitudes towards L1 use and whether it was a resource that assisted or distracted the learning process in the classroom. The results showed that there is strong evidence of positive attitudes in the teacher&#39 response towards the use of L1 in the classroom.     
            </p>
            <p>Despite these and other studies&#39 contributions, some limitations can be found. For example, most of them were not conducted in Costa Rica. In addition, some researchers did not work directly with the participants; that is, they only compared studies. Moreover, there was no restriction to a specific level or country. There were also self-evaluations; therefore, there were only subjective results. Finally, interpretations were based on a very small sample population or very large sample sizes. To provide more research in order to find out how the use of L1 can be addressed in the classroom, this proposed study will be in Costa Rica and work directly with forty participants to guarantee the validity of its results.This paper provides a significant source to L2 teachers who struggle every time they use their L1 during the lessons. This study can provide a guide to those teachers who decide on how they will teach their classes regarding the use of just L1, L2, or a combination of both.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the main goal of this study is to explore the attitudes English teachers have when they realize they are using the L1 during their lessons and the purpose surrounding the need to clarify teachers' minds regarding this, so they will not feel uncomfortable when doing it.

        <header>Problem Statement</header>
            <p>After analyzing preliminary research to obtain more knowledge about the use of L1 in foreign language classrooms, it was found that there are several studies around this topic in which teachers and students support this method because of its reported positive results (García, 2009; Yusuf, 2010; Mazzaferro, 2018; Akulova, 2019; Fallas, 2019). But equally as important, there are dissenting voices on the subject, such as those by Turnbull (2001 as cited in Taskin 2011), Fishman (1966 as cited in Vogel & García 2017), Añasco & Salha (2014), Genesee (2015). 
            In Costa Rica, although it is not explicitly acknowledged, the MEP English program is ruled by monolingual ideologies, which, according to Genesee (as cited in Rojas, 2016), “align English language teaching with strategies that promote strict use of the target language” (p. 11). This point of view lacks support since there is a misbelief stating that “the use of the L1 decreases the amount of time spent in the target language; hence students&#39 exposure to L2 input is reduced” (Hall, Smith, &  Wicaksono, 2011, as cited in Rojas, 2016, p. 10). This circumstance raises questions as to the effectiveness of using only L2 to acquire the TL. However, according to personal experience and that of some fellow teachers, not being allowed to use the L1 when teaching English can cause teachers to experience guilt, regret, anxiety, frustration, and other feelings when thinking about or actually using L1 in the classroom. Some studies conducted in Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Greece, and Canada (Akulova, 2019; Copland & Neokleous, 2011; Edstrom, 2006) have demonstrated that some teachers felt at least one of these aforementioned emotions during their lessons, given that, they struggle with what is believed to be ideal in the language classroom versus the reality of their practices. This practical problem prompts the researchers to conduct research that provides insight into English as Foreign Language (EFL) teachers&#39 attitudes about L1 usage in Costa Rican contexts.

            <p>Based on the focus of our research, we followed a QUAL-Quan method. This means the content represents the qualities of the participants; however, it does not leave numbers behind. Some quantitative information was also obtained to complement the results. The depth was exploratory; according to Sevilla (2021), an exploratory study seeks to unveil a preliminary understanding of the investigating subject while opening doors to discover new content. Our research showed some deep analysis of different sources that guided our steps to have a clearer perspective and build a more robust study. These sources also contributed to giving us ideas to get our own conclusions about the topic; thus, we discovered new characteristics that were important in the results. Given these aspects, we have considered our depth as exploratory.

            <p>The present chapter compiles the data analysis for the study, whose general objective was to explore what common attitudes MEP English teachers hold towards their own use of L1 in the classroom by conducting an exploratory sequential study in the Western zone of Costa Rica. The analysis will be based on the coding process that resulted from qualitative semi-structured interviews and a post-interview reflection with four participants. Descriptive coding was used, which according to Wa-Mbaleka, consists of using a phrase or a key word that summarizes the essence of what a participant has said in a specific type of data (2021, workshop 2: Data Analysis, Handout 1). To attain anonymity and a better organization of the data analysis, we will use the following nomenclature to cite the participants’ exact words. 
            </p>
            <p>Once the raw data were coded, and then put into categories, the following themes or mother categories emerged: conflicting perspectives around the use of Spanish in the English classroom, common grounds regarding the use of Spanish in the English classroom, and Teachers’ insights for communication alternatives to avoid excessive use of L1. With that in mind, the following subsection displays the data analysis concerning the first theme.

            <p>Since this is an exploratory sequential analysis, this phase of the study will be concerned with exploring whether the themes identified in the qualitative part are shared by a larger group of in-service MEP English teachers from the Western Area of the Central Valley of Costa Rica. As stated elsewhere in this report, the goal of this research is to explore what common attitudes MEP English teachers hold towards their own use of L1 (Spanish) in the classroom. Due to the descriptive nature of the study, the analysis seeks no statistical generalizations of any sort, but to characterize general impressions on the issue using basic numerical analysis so that: 1) a more thorough exploration on the subject can be achieved and 2) an avenue for further research can be opened. After administering the qualitative instrument, some interrogatives emerged which called for the need of further exploration through a basic numerical analysis for which we administered a quantitative survey to a larger sample of 36 participants. This survey was administered to MEP English teachers from the Western Area of Costa Rica whose first language was Spanish, had at least one year of English teaching experience in MEP, and did not belong to any bilingual high schools. To ensure validity of the participants, four screening questions were used at first; that means the analyzed answers were taken only from the participants who truly met the selection criteria. For the purpose of organization, the analysis will continue the same organizational pattern as the interviews, that is: behavioral, cognitive, and affective aspects around the use of translanguaging in the English language classroom.

            <P>To a great extent, the semi-structured interviews, the follow-up reflection forms, and the survey administered in this two-phase approach contribute their share to shaping the results. It is paramount to  points out that the hypothesis was confirmed since, from the qualitative and quantitative review above, key findings emerge: MEP English teachers from the Western area of Costa Rica share common attitudes concerning their use of L1. In terms of affective aspects, most of the participants highlighted emotions such as guilt and frustration, but also confidence. Considering this last regard crucial, the results of this study found clear support for the use of Spanish by teachers in the EFL classroom. From these findings, it is almost certain that these data relate to the fact that it is clear that even if they might feel frustrated and guilty, they acknowledge several cases to resort to the use of L1 for effective and beneficial teaching-learning purposes; taking into account the importance of having control over its use to not fall into the trap of a non-purpose excessive use. Nonetheless, the results of this study are to be interpreted with caution given that the sample does not allow for extrapolation to further contexts.
